# ðŸ“Œ Business Flow for Subscription Management System
## Step 1: User Registration & Authentication
### ðŸ“Œ Goal: Allow users to sign up and log in to access the system.
### ðŸ”¹ Process:

1. A new user registers using email, password, and other details.
2. The system hashes the password and stores it securely in the User table.
3. The user logs in with valid credentials, and a session or JWT token is generated.
4. The system verifies the token for all API requests.

## Step 2: Subscription Plan Selection
### ðŸ“Œ Goal: Allow users to choose a subscription plan.
### ðŸ”¹ Process:

1. The system fetches available plans from the SubscriptionPlan table.
2. The user selects a plan and confirms.
3. The system checks if the user already has an active subscription.
4. If no active subscription exists, proceed to the payment step.

## Step 3: Payment Processing
### ðŸ“Œ Goal: Charge the user for the selected plan.
### ðŸ”¹ Process:

1. The system calculates the total price (plan price, taxes, discounts, if any).
2. The user enters payment details (credit card, PayPal, Stripe, etc.).
3. The system processes the payment using a payment gateway.
4. If payment is successful:
5. Create a record in the Payment table.
6. Generate an invoice in the Invoice table.
7. Activate the subscription in the Subscription table.
8. Send a confirmation email.
9. If payment fails:

    9.1 Store the failure reason in the Payment table.

    9.2 Ask the user to retry the payment.

## Step 4: Subscription Activation & Management
### ðŸ“Œ Goal: Activate, manage, and track the subscription lifecycle.
### ðŸ”¹ Process:

1. Once payment is successful, the system creates an entry in the Subscription table:

    status = Active

    start_date = current date

    end_date = start_date + billing_cycle

    renewal_date = end_date (if auto-renew enabled)

2. The user can:
    1. View active and past subscriptions.
    2. Cancel or pause the subscription (if allowed).
    3. Change the plan (upgrade/downgrade).

## Step 5: Recurring Billing & Auto-Renewal
### ðŸ“Œ Goal: Automatically charge users for subscription renewals.
### ðŸ”¹ Process:

1. A scheduled background job (Cron Job / Celery Task) runs daily to check subscriptions that need renewal.
2. If the renewal_date is today: 

    2.1 The system attempts to charge the stored payment method.

    2.2 If successful, update Subscription with a new end_date.

    2.3 If failed, notify the user and retry in X days before marking as expired.

## Step 6: Subscription Expiry & Grace Period
### ðŸ“Œ Goal: Handle expired subscriptions gracefully.
### ðŸ”¹ Process:

1. When a subscription reaches the end_date, the system checks:
   
    1.1. If auto-renew is enabled â†’ Attempt renewal.
   
    1.2. If auto-renew is disabled â†’ Move status = Expired.
   
    1.3 If a grace period is offered, extend access temporarily.
   
    1.4 Notify users about expiry and offer reactivation options.

## Step 7: Invoice Generation & Management
### ðŸ“Œ Goal: Generate invoices for each successful payment.
### ðŸ”¹ Process:

After every successful payment, create a new record in the Invoice table.
The invoice includes:
User details
Plan details
Payment amount & method
Transaction ID
Users can view and download past invoices.

## Step 8: Cancellation & Refunds
### ðŸ“Œ Goal: Allow users to cancel their subscription.
### ðŸ”¹ Process:

1. The user requests cancellation before end_date.
2. The system updates the Subscription status to Canceled.
3. If the plan allows refunds:
    1. The system initiates a partial/full refund.
4. Updates the Payment table with a refund transaction.
5. If no refund, the user can continue using the service until end_date.

## Step 9: Notifications & Alerts
### ðŸ“Œ Goal: Keep users informed about payments, renewals, and expirations.
### ðŸ”¹ Process:

1. Send email/SMS notifications for:
2. Payment success/failure
3. Subscription activation/cancellation
4. Upcoming renewal reminders
5. Expiry warnings
6. Store notification logs for tracking.

## Step 10: Admin Panel & Reports (Optional)
### ðŸ“Œ Goal: Allow admins to manage users, subscriptions, and payments.

Admins can:
1. View & manage users
2. See active/inactive subscriptions
3. Process refunds
